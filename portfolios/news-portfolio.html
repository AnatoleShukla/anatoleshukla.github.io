          Women’s Basketball Team Members Pursue Title IX and Provost’s Office Inquiries into Coach Candice Signor-Brown</b></a>
      </div>
      <div class="blurb">
          <i>"-	On July 14, an anonymous post was submitted by a Vassar alumna and former basketball player,
            alleging that Vassar’s then-women’s basketball coach, Candice Signor-Brown (then Candice Brown), 
            sexually assaulted her after a basketball game in her senior year in 2012 and continued to sexually
            harass her throughout the rest of the season. Six days after the post went live, Swarthmore women’s
            basketball players sent an email, signed by all members of the team, to Provost Sarah Willie-LeBreton,
            all of the deans, the Swarthmore Title IX office, and former Director of Athletics Adam Hertz to bring
            the Instagram post to their attention. "</i>

          Trans and Non-Binary Students Face Barriers in On-Campus Housing</b></a>
      </div>
      <div class="blurb">
          <i>"-	Swarthmore’s first co-ed dorms were piloted in 1971, when sections of Mary Lyon, Wharton, Willets,
            and Worth became co-ed living spaces. Nearly fifty years later, the only gendered dorms that remain are
            Parrish and Dana third, which is women’s only. Despite the prevalence of gender-neutral housing,
            transgender and non-binary students continue to face challenges in terms of their ability to obtain
            housing in which they feel comfortable and accommodated."</i>

          Black Affinity Coalition and Swarthmore Strike Coalition Begin Strike</b></a>
      </div>
      <div class="blurb">
          <i>"On Wednesday, November 11, the Black Affinity Coalition published a statement and list of demands in Voices, a student-run news and media publication at Swarthmore. In this document, the BAC demands the college to allocate more resources towards the equitable treatment and inclusion of students with marginalized identities, namely BIPOC (Black, indigenous, people of color), disabled, first-generation and low-income, undocumented, and LGBTQ+ students. Core members of the BAC have chosen to remain anonymous. In an open letter to faculty and staff from Nov. 13, the BAC committed to striking indefinitely until the demands are fully met."</i>

          Changes in Public Safety Protocols and Garnet Pledge Enforcement Draw Mixed Reactions From Students</b></a>
      </div>
      <div class="blurb">
          <i>"Since the implementation of the Garnet Pledge, the set of rules and guidelines intended to mitigate COVID-19 on Swarthmore’s campus that all students had to sign before the beginning of the semester, Public Safety infrastructure on campus has fundamentally changed. Before, students mostly turned to Pub Safe whenever they were accidentally locked out of their dorms or needed rides to distant campus buildings late at night. Now that Pub Safe has a key role in enforcing the pledge that could cost students their on-campus housing, students’ opinions on Pub Safe have become more polarized."</i>
