          <i>"-	On July 14, an anonymous post was submitted by a Vassar alumna and former basketball player,
            alleging that Vassar’s then-women’s basketball coach, Candice Signor-Brown (then Candice Brown), 
            sexually assaulted her after a basketball game in her senior year in 2012 and continued to sexually
            harass her throughout the rest of the season. Six days after the post went live, Swarthmore women’s
            basketball players sent an email, signed by all members of the team, to Provost Sarah Willie-LeBreton,
            all of the deans, the Swarthmore Title IX office, and former Director of Athletics Adam Hertz to bring
            the Instagram post to their attention. "</i>

          <i>"-	Swarthmore’s first co-ed dorms were piloted in 1971, when sections of Mary Lyon, Wharton, Willets,
            and Worth became co-ed living spaces. Nearly fifty years later, the only gendered dorms that remain are
            Parrish and Dana third, which is women’s only. Despite the prevalence of gender-neutral housing,
            transgender and non-binary students continue to face challenges in terms of their ability to obtain
            housing in which they feel comfortable and accommodated."</i>

          <i>"Eric said that Chinese people have been turning to social media to share their dissent.
            'So I think [Dr. Li’s death] was the source of the dissent and I think that people communicated
            through mostly again posting on social media. Of course, on non-Chinese ones that are censored
            by the government like Facebook, like Instagram, but also very, very prominently on WeChat,
            which is the one social media tool used by Chinese citizens and people. Again, I think both
            generations were expressing their dissents for that.'"</i>

            European countries to the U.S. as an attempt to combat the further spread of COVID-19 to, and
            within, the U.S. American citizens were exempt from the travel restriction. The travel restrictions
            have affected students studying at Swarthmore in various ways, including forcing students studying
            abroad to return to the U.S. prematurely."</i>
