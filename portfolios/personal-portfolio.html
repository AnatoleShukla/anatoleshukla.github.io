          <i>"-	When Susan Potter passed away in 2015 at the age of 87, National Geographic released a documentary chronicling not only the story of her life, but more importantly, of her death. During her life, she wore several substantial hats—she was a World War II survivor, an activist for people with disabilities, and a mentor for students at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She survived 26 surgeries, melanoma, breast cancer, and diabetes. But her most important hat was one that will render her immortal: her role in the Visible Human Project as a body donor.

          <i>"While Colonial American art is best-known for being drab and more often than not concerning wealthy white landowners as their subject matter, it does possess its relative merits. What differentiates Colonial American art from European art at the time is that as opposed to England’s Joshua Reynolds and France’s Jacques-Louis David, no such person exists as the archetypal Colonial artist. Every painter in the thirteen colonies had to find their own means to produce art in such an utterly bleak and artless society."</i>
